Autonomous Payment Agent System - Layer-by-Layer Action Plan
1. Treasury Dashboard (UI for Controls & Logs)
- Build visual log of all agent actions (who, what, when, where, why)
- Include override features (manual approval / kill switch)
- Display system health & transaction monitoring
- Support filters: time, currency, counterparty, status
- Exportable audit trails (PDF/CSV)
- Role-based access control (admin vs observer)
2. Agent Orchestration Layer
- Scheduler engine (e.g. cron-style or event-based)
- Support stateful agents (pause, resume, retry logic)
- Trigger types: time-based, event-based (e.g. rate spike), user-initiated
- Agent identity + authorization (can agent X act on account Y?)
- Logs & metrics per agent lifecycle
- Dependency tree: e.g. only run after pre-checks, approvals
3. Decision Engine (AI Logic / Rule Layer)
- Start with rule-based logic (e.g. YAML configs)
- Support hybrid logic: rules + LLM
- Plug-in models (OpenAI, Claude, local agents)
- Include scenario simulation: what-if gas > X, FX < Y
- Record decision rationale in logs
- Add scoring / confidence metrics
- Build safeguards (e.g. no action if conflicting thresholds)
4. Action Execution Layer (Payment / Swap)
- Abstract execution interface (sendCrypto, sendFiat, swapAssets)
Autonomous Payment Agent System - Layer-by-Layer Action Plan
- Handle retries, gas estimation, stuck tx resolution
- Time-sensitive execution (e.g. execute swap only if slippage < 1%)
- MPC / multisig signing infrastructure
- Integrate delay queues or buffers for fiat settlement lags
- Response normalization across rails (confirmations, tx hashes, SWIFT refs)
5. Monitoring & Alerting
- Track every agent action in real-time (Grafana or custom UI)
- Set up alerts: high slippage, repeated tx failures, unexpected behavior
- Index logs (ElasticSearch or Loki)
- Integrate push notifications (Telegram, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Visual dashboards by asset, agent, region
6. Data Layer (DB + Oracles)
- PostgreSQL for internal structured data
- Redis for caching recent exchange rates, tx data
- Oracle sources: Chainlink, CoinGecko API, bank FX feeds
- Sync chain data via The Graph / Covalent for on-chain analysis
- Store past agent decisions to support feedback loops
- Sanitize all inputs - especially from 3rd-party oracles
7. Integration Layer (Wallets, Banks, APIs)
- Plug-in crypto SDKs (ethers.js, Web3.py, Solana SDK)
- MPC wallet infra: Fireblocks, Lit, or Gnosis
- Fiat APIs: Tink, Yapily, or direct OpenBanking endpoints
- KYB compliance with all counterparties
- Swap routing via 1inch, Paraswap, 0x, or fiat FX desks
- Unified abstraction layer across banks/wallets

8. Optional: Learning/Feedback Layer
- Store result of each decision (success/fail, duration, fees)
- Train a model or heuristic to detect better decisions
- Use feedback loops to auto-adjust thresholds
- Flag suboptimal actions for human review
General Considerations
- Immutable audit logs for compliance
- GDPR/data privacy enforcement
- Kill switch to suspend all agents
- Agent health scoring and version control
- Simulated (dry-run) mode before live mode
