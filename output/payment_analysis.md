APPROVAL REQUEST: REQUESTING USER APPROVAL for payment execution

**Optimal Payment Method and Routing Strategy:**
- **Method:** Self-custody wallet (USDT/USDC)
- **Justification:** The self-custody wallet (USDT/USDC) is the optimal method due to its fast processing time (5-30 minutes), low fees ($35.00), and high reliability (99.9%). This method is preferred based on the user's preference for self-custody wallet transfers.

**Complete Cost Breakdown and Execution Timeline:**
- **Total Amount to Send:** $5,000.00 USD
- **Conversion Rate:** 1 USD = 1.0 USDT
- **Fees:** $35.00
- **Amount Received by Recipient:** 4965.00 USDT
- **Execution Timeline:** 5-30 minutes

**Technical Implementation Steps for Chosen Method:**
1. Confirm the recipient's USDT wallet address with Alice.
2. Initiate the USDT/USDC transfer from your self-custody wallet to Alice's wallet.
3. Monitor the transaction until it is confirmed on the blockchain.
4. Confirm receipt of funds in Alice's wallet.

**Risk Considerations and Balance Impact Assessment:**
- The payment execution will not violate the minimum balance requirement of $5,000. The current account balance is $25,000, which is well above the minimum balance requirement.

**Backup Options if Primary Method Fails:**
- If the cryptocurrency route fails or is delayed, the next step would be to use a SWIFT wire transfer.
- **Cost for SWIFT Wire:** $100.00
- **Amount Received by Recipient:** 4900.00 USDT

**USER ACTION REQUIRED:**
- Please review the above details and provide explicit go/no-go authorization for the payment execution.
