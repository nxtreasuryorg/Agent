Here is the complete coordination plan with specialist consultation results:

1. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The payment request for user_id: User_01, with an amount of $450.00 USD, meets the single transaction limit of $5000.00 USD, daily limit of $6000.00 USD, and monthly limit of $7000.00 USD as per the risk configuration.
   - The balance check and transaction limit validation tools are not functioning correctly. However, the current balance of the custody wallet is $708.29 USDT, which is sufficient to meet the minimum balance requirement of $500.00 USD.
