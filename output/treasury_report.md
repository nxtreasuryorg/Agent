The payment request to send $1,000 USD to Bob is compliant with the company's criteria and does not violate any risk policies. The current account balance is more than sufficient to cover this payment, and the post-payment balance will still meet the minimum balance requirement. I will proceed with the payment execution after obtaining the necessary user approval.
