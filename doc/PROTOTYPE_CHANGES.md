## 🔄 How to Restore Full Version

### Step 1: Restore crew.py
1. Uncomment all mock tool imports at the top
2. Uncomment the entire `market_analyst` method (lines 67-82)
3. Uncomment the `market_analysis_task` method (lines 118-125)
4. Add back mock tools to Payment Specialist and Risk Assessor tool lists:
   ```python
   tools=[
       TreasuryUSDTPaymentTool(),
       ExcelAnalysisTool(),
       MockMarketDataTool(),  # Add back
       MockAuditLoggerTool()  # Add back
   ]
   ```
5. Add back Market Analyst to crew agents list:
   ```python
   agents=[
       self.payment_specialist(),
       self.market_analyst(),  # Add back
       self.risk_assessor()
   ]
   ```

### Step 2: Restore agents.yaml
1. Uncomment the entire `market_analyst` section (lines 33-47)
2. Restore investment references in Treasury Manager goals:
   ```yaml
   goal: >
     Coordinate treasury operations by analyzing requests, delegating tasks to specialist agents,
     and making final authorization decisions for payments and investments
   ```

### Step 3: Restore tasks.yaml
1. Uncomment the entire `market_analysis_task` section
2. Add back investment delegation to `treasury_coordination_task`:
   ```yaml
   description: >
     Analyze request: {treasury_request}
     
     Extract payment details and delegate to specialists:
     1. Extract payment amount and recipient
     2. Delegate risk assessment to Risk Assessor
     3. Delegate payment analysis to Payment Specialist
     4. Delegate investment analysis to Market Analyst (if surplus available)
   ```
3. Add back investment proposal to `final_treasury_report_task`:
   ```yaml
   description: >
     Create final report for: {treasury_request}
     
     Combine all specialist results into simple summary:
     1. Risk assessment results
     2. Payment proposal
     3. Investment proposal (if applicable)
     4. Final recommendations
   ```
4. Add back market analysis task to final report context:
   ```yaml
   context:
     - treasury_coordination_task
     - payment_processing_task
     - market_analysis_task  # Add back
     - risk_assessment_task
   ```

## 🧪 Testing After Restoration

After restoring the full version, test these scenarios:

1. **Payment Processing**: Verify Payment Specialist works with mock tools
2. **Investment Analysis**: Verify Market Analyst responds to surplus detection
3. **Risk Assessment**: Verify Risk Assessor works with all tools
4. **Team Coordination**: Verify Treasury Manager delegates to all three specialists
5. **End-to-End Workflow**: Test complete payment → investment workflow

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

- All mock tools are preserved and can be replaced with real implementations
- Investment features are ready to be enhanced with real market data
- The hierarchical team structure supports adding more specialist agents
- User approval workflow is maintained across all operations
- Audit logging can be enhanced with real compliance systems

## 🚀 Prototype Deployment

The prototype is now ready for deployment with:
- Core payment processing functionality
- Risk assessment and compliance checking
- Excel data analysis capabilities
- User approval workflow
- Simulation mode for safety

All operations are in simulation/mock mode to ensure safe testing without real financial transactions.
