## üß† **Dynamic Agent Selection**

The multi-agent system can **intelligently select which agents to activate** based on user data analysis, reducing costs and improving efficiency:

### **Data-Driven Agent Selection Logic:**

The system analyzes user data to determine optimal agent configuration:

**Analysis Criteria:**

- **Transaction Volume**: Triggers Execution Agent for high-throughput processing  
- **Compliance Requirements**: Enables Risk Assessment Agent for regulatory adherence
- **Data Sources**: Activates Data Sync Agent for complex integration needs
- **Audit Requirements**: Enables Audit & Compliance Agent for trail management

**Decision Framework:**
- Treasury Manager Agent: Always active (core coordination)
- Specialized agents: Activated based on user profile complexity
- Dynamic scaling: Agents can be added/removed as requirements change

### **Agent Selection Examples:**

| **User Profile** | **Data Characteristics** | **Selected Agents** | **Rationale** |
|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Personal User** | Bank account + low volume | Treasury Manager only | Simple payments, minimal complexity |
| **Crypto Trader** | Multiple wallets + DeFi | Treasury + Market + Execution | Need real-time market analysis |
| **Small Business** | Mixed accounts + compliance | Treasury + Risk + Audit | Regulatory requirements |
| **Enterprise** | High volume + multi-region | All 6 agents | Full complexity and scale |
| **Remittance Service** | Cross-border + high volume | Treasury + Market + Execution + Risk | Speed and compliance critical |
