## 🧠 **Dynamic Agent Selection**

The multi-agent system can **intelligently select which agents to activate** based on user data analysis, reducing costs and improving efficiency:

### **Data-Driven Agent Selection Logic:**

The system analyzes user data to determine optimal agent configuration:

**Analysis Criteria:**
- **Payment Volume**: Primary factor for execution agent activation
- **Surplus Funds**: Triggers investment management capabilities for leftover balances
- **Crypto Wallets**: Activates Market Intelligence Agent for DeFi analysis and yield opportunities
- **Transaction Volume**: Triggers Execution Agent for high-throughput processing  
- **Compliance Requirements**: Enables Risk Assessment Agent for regulatory adherence
- **Data Sources**: Activates Data Sync Agent for complex integration needs
- **Audit Requirements**: Enables Audit & Compliance Agent for trail management

**Decision Framework:**
- Treasury Manager Agent: Always active (core coordination)
- Specialized agents: Activated based on user profile complexity
- Dynamic scaling: Agents can be added/removed as requirements change

### **Agent Selection Examples:**

| **User Profile** | **Data Characteristics** | **Selected Agents** | **Rationale** |
|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Personal User** | Bank account + low volume + surplus funds | Treasury Manager only | Simple payments + basic investment of leftover funds |
| **Crypto Trader** | Multiple wallets + DeFi + active trading | Treasury + Market + Execution | Payment processing + yield optimization on idle funds |
| **Small Business** | Mixed accounts + compliance + cash flow | Treasury + Risk + Audit | Payment execution + compliance + surplus investment |
| **Enterprise** | High volume + multi-region + complex treasury | All 6 agents | Full payment optimization + sophisticated investment strategies |
| **Remittance Service** | Cross-border + high volume + float management | Treasury + Market + Execution + Risk | Fast payments + investment of transaction float |

## 🧠 Agent Intelligence & Behavior

### BDI Framework Implementation

Each agent operates using the **Belief-Desire-Intention** model as described in [IBM's agentic architecture](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-architecture):

#### Treasury Manager Agent (Cognitive Architecture)
**Beliefs Formation:**
- Current market conditions: Volatility levels, liquidity status, price trends, yield opportunities
- Account balances: Multi-currency positions across platforms, surplus funds available for investment
- Payment requirements: Transaction amounts, destinations, urgency levels
- Investment landscape: Available yields, risk-return profiles, market opportunities
- Regulatory status: Regional compliance requirements for both payments and investments

**Desires Hierarchy:**
1. **Execute payments** (Priority 1.0): Complete all required payment transactions first
2. **Ensure compliance** (Priority 0.95): Regulatory adherence for both payments and investments
3. **Optimize surplus investment** (Priority 0.9): Maximize returns on leftover funds after payments
4. **Minimize risk** (Priority 0.85): Capital preservation for both payment and investment activities
5. **Minimize cost** (Priority 0.8): Fee optimization for payments, cost-effective investment allocation
6. **Maximize speed** (Priority 0.6): Fast payment execution, efficient investment placement

**Intentions Planning:**
- **Payment-first execution**: Complete all payment transactions before considering investments
- **Surplus identification**: Calculate remaining funds available for investment after payment completion
- **Route selection**: Algorithm chooses optimal cost-effective payment paths
- **Investment allocation**: Automated surplus fund investment based on risk tolerance and yield opportunities
- **Timing strategy**: Market-driven execution timing for both payments and investment decisions
- **Risk mitigation**: Automated safeguards and circuit breakers for dual-purpose operations

#### Market Analysis Agent (Reactive + Deliberative)
**Reactive Capabilities:**
- Immediate response to rate changes above 5% threshold affecting payment costs
- Real-time volatility spike detection and alerts for both payment timing and investment opportunities
- Yield opportunity alerts when investment returns exceed threshold levels
- Automated notification system for treasury manager on market conditions

**Deliberative Analysis:**
- Strategic market trend analysis for payment optimization and investment forecasting
- Arbitrage opportunity identification across exchanges for both payment routing and investment placement
- Investment yield analysis and risk-return optimization for surplus funds
- Optimal route calculation with confidence scoring for payments
- Investment opportunity evaluation with expected return calculations
- Reasoning-based recommendations with market context for both payment execution and surplus allocation
